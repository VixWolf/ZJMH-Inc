README: This is a basic standard project for the RowdyHacks Hackathon.
Our team consists of Michael Wilmer, Hayden Oesterle, Jan Suarez-Inestroza (The GOAT), and Zander Hartman.
Our project is to make a time travel machine.

The test dates we will use are in reference to the hit movie Back to the Future. These dates are:
- October 21, 2015 (Date when Marty McFly reaches the future)

Here are the Tasks:
Hayden: Design the DeLorean
Jan: Review code; Work on code structure and basic outline (README);
Michael: if statement: if mph >= 88 (rough draft)
Zander: if statement: if mph < 88

Basic Outline:
The idea is to recreate the DeLorean from Back to the Future using simple java code. When the code is run, the user will be asked to input their speed. 
If it reaches 88 or over, the car will time travel. Otherwise, they will enjoy a nice road trip.
For the time travel procedure, the sequence will start with the statement "Flux Capacitor activated!"
Afterwards, the program will ask for the month using the first three letter (EX: March - MAR / February - FEB)
Next it will ask for the day in integer form, ranging from 1 to 31. [If there is time, we clarify how many days per month.]
Next is the year. Any year may be input, as long as it has four digits (XXXX).
Add a switch for AM to PM, likely as if statements.
Next is hour. If (X) is < 10, add a 0 afterwards as to not mess up formatting.
Lastly is minutes. Have minutes range from (00 to 59), scanner as well. All inputs are scanner.
Once all variables are initialized, the date that they have traveled to will appear in the DeLorean's windshield.
[We will add bonus statements below the DeLorean for fun based off of the movie. Example, the date when Marty McFly returns to the future.]
**[DEPENDENT ON MICHAEL: We can add a feature that shows how far away in time the present is from the time time traveled to. (Ask Jan if confused)]

Once this is all done, the code will be reviewed by all parties and Jan will share it to Devpost. Afterwards, we vibe to Yuno Miles.
