README: This is a basic standard project for the RowdyHacks Hackathon.
Our team consists of Michael Wilmer, Hayden Oesterle, Jan Suarez-Inestroza (The GOAT), and Zander Hartman.
Our project is to make a calendar that inputs the current date, as well as take a date from the past and provide information based on the date/time in-between the given dates.

The test dates we will use are in reference to the hit movie Back to the Future. These dates are:
- October 21, 2015 (Date when Marty McFly reaches the future)

Here are the Tasks:
Hayden: Find the "art" for the Delorians
Jan: Review current code and update it, collab with hayden
Michael: Print statements
Zander: Look up important dates regarding Back to the Future.
